    <div class="bbb"><p>这是一个虐心的相遇和别离。2004年8月3日，启程。他（飞行器）要去到她（水星）的身边，因为这是他存在的唯一意义。而她，无卫星陪伴，也以为自己注定永远孤寂。
    他们(水星和地球)之间1.5亿公里的距离，他本可以就那么径直的到达她，但他知道那样他只会跌入太阳的引力。（飞行器需要减速才能到达水星）于是他兜兜转转三次经过她的身旁，然后又匆匆转身离去。咫尺远近，却无法靠近，他只能在她耳边呢喃：想做个梦给你。
    经过6年半时间，长达79亿公里的旅程，他进入了她的轨道。
    那是在50多倍于他们直线距离的里程中，在幽深荒凉的星系里，最曲折艰难的旅程。
    现在，孤单的她，终于也有了追随者，他的目光从未离开过她。她的美，也终于透过他的眼睛（照相机），为世人所见。
    但是这段用6.5年艰难的旅程换来的陪伴只维持了不到4年。
    2015年4月30日燃料耗尽的他，终于永恒的坠入了她的怀抱。 <br>

    This is a story of heart-wrenching encounters and parting.
    Departure on August 3, 2004. He (aircraft) wants to go to her (Mercury) side because this is the only meaning of his existence.
    And she, without satellites, thought she was destined to be lonely forever.
    With a distance of 150 million kilometers between them (Mercury and the Earth), he could have reached her straightly, but he knew that he would only fall into the sun because of the gravity of the sun. (The aircraft needs to slow down to reach Mercury)
    So he flew past her three times around, then hurriedly turned away. So far and near, but he was unable to get close, he could only whisper in her ear: I want to weave a dream for you.
    After 6 and a half years, a journey of 7.9 billion kilometers, he entered her orbit.
    That was the most tortuous journey in the desolate galaxy in a mileage that was more than 50 times their straight-line distance.
    Now, she finally has a follower, and his eyes never leave her. Her beauty was finally seen by the world through his eyes (camera).
    But the companionship gained from this difficult journey of 6.5 years lasted less than 4 years.
    He ran out of fuel on April 30, 2015, and finally fell into her arms forever.
